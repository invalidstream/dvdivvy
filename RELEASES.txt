Version 1.0 - Oct 5, 2013
-------------------------
First working version. Posted to blog as http://www.subfurther.com/blog/2013/10/05/dvdivvy/


Known bugs to fix:
* Deleting last segment raises exception
* Table should clear when a different movie is opened
* Destination button's NSSavePanel sheet's directory dialog button shouldn't say "Export" (suggests that export will begin immediately)
* On window resize, would be more useful for preview to stretch horizontally than table
